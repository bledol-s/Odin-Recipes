    <h3>The tasty Chicken in a pot</h3>
    <p>I just made this tonight, and it tasted great! It's a very simple dish, but you'd never know it by the complex flavor, reviewer Rhea says.</p>
    <p>This dish uses just one skillet to prepare. Quick, easy and delicious. Tomato paste and chicken broth combine to make a tasty sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms</li>

        <h4>Directions for preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the broth, tomato paste, ground black pepper, oregano, salt and garlic. Mix well and set aside.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken in the bread crumbs, coating well. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the chicken in the oil for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved broth mixture and the mushrooms to the skillet and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside, covering to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Bring broth mixture to a boil and cook for 4 minutes, or until reduced to desired thickness. Spoon sauce over the chicken and serve.</li>

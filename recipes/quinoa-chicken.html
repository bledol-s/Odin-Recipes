        <h4>Directions for preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir cooked quinoa and diced tomatoes into chicken mixture; bring to a simmer and cook long enough for flavors to meld, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
